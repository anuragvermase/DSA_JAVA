Sorting : Arranging data in increasing or decreasing order.

Ex:2 4 10 15 27 -> True (Increasing)
Ex:20 7 3 -5 -8 -> True (Decreasing)

Ex:     1 2 3 7 4 9 6 -> Not sorted on the basis of value
factor: 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 -> Sorted on the basis of factor count

Techniques of sorting :
bubble sort
selection sort
insertion sort
merge sort
quick sort
bucket sort
radix sort
etc..

If a problem have many steps and one of its step is sorting, then

Steps to solve Problem:
1.   2.   3.   4.

** if the first (1) step is the sorting step then we cannot use sorting techniques,
we use Inbuilt sorting function to sort the array.

i.e. Arrays.sort(arr); -> this function sort the array in increasing order

T.C : O(NlogN)        S.C. : O(N)
worst T.C. : O(NÂ²)
